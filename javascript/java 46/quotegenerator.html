    <!-- Quote of the Day
    Create random quote app, that shows a random quote when ever the user loads the App(page) or clicks the get random quote button.
       Create a function that returns a random quote from the array of quotes that's given. Remember that there's a nice function for random numbers in the MDN documentation for Math.rand().
    Note: Sometimes it's a good idea to create multiple functions, that do one specific thing only, to make the code more readable and easier to maintain / extend.
       Add the needed JavaScript to load a new quote, when the button below the quote is used.
       Optional: Style to your pleasing & feel free to load/use bootstrap via CDN. -->
