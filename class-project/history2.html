                <p>The Nigerian culture is so broad and diverse. The country has over 50 languages and over 250 dialects and ethnic groups. These ethnic groups all together contribute to shape and define what one today considers the unique culture in Nigeria. So in order to describe culture in Nigeria we need to identify its constituent subcultures which include the Hausa-Fulani Islamic based culture in the north, the Igbo culture in southeast, the Yoruba culture predominate in the southwest, the Tiv and Efik-Ibibio culture of North central Nigeria, the Edo culture in the south central which is Christain influenced and Ijaw culture of the coastal south along the Niger Delta. It is this diversity of subcultures which is the most unique identity of what is Nigerian culture in general. Other important aspects of Nigeria culture include: literary and performing arts, family life and structure, traditional music and  dance, sports, religion, cuisine and gastronomy, fashion and clothing.</p>

              <p>Music and dance is an important aspect of Nigeria’s culture and this includes many kinds of folk and popular music as well as dancing forms which are known worldwide. For example the late singer and social activist Fela Kuti (with his Afro Beat music style) was instrumental in Nigeria's musical development. Another well known musician is Sunny Ade with his Juju Music style of music. Traditional musicians use a number of diverse instruments, such as Gogon drums. The kora and the kakaki are also important. Other traditional cultural expressions are found in the various masquerades of Nigeria. Music and  dance are used for entertainment as well as for other societal functions such as child naming ceremonies, burials and for the installation of local kings.  
                  Literary and performing arts
                  Nigeria is famous for its English language literature. Things Fall Apart, by Chinua Achebe, is an important book in African literature. With over eight million copies sold worldwide, it has been translated into 50 languages, making Achebe the most translated African writer of all time. Some of Nigerias most prominent authors include Wole Soyinka, the first Black writer to win the Noble Prize of literature in 1986, Cyprian Ekwensi, John Pepper Clark, Gabriel Okara, Abubakar Imam, Flora Nwapa, Zulu Sofola, Amos Tutuola, Chukwemeka Ike, Elechi Amadi, Chimamandia Adiche to mention these few.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-8">
                  <p>Nigerians have always loved movies but it was after Nigeria’s independence that the interest to concentrate on local indigenous based movies and scripts evolved. The abundance of good authors and their works means that there is reservoir of materials for film script writers and since the 1990s the Nigerian movie industry also known as Nollywood developed. Nollywood has emerged as a fast-growing cultural force all over Africa. The emergence of home-grown movie stars such as Genevieve Nnaji, Omotola Jalade Ekeinde and Pete Edochie have influenced the way Nigerians dress, speak and socialize Nigeria, even in the highly conservative moslem north of the country. </p>
